DLink ships a utility named SmartConsole to monitor events from their DLINK DGS
1100 series switches which is windows only. This is a quick hack to fetch the
events on any OS running python name D*-Not-So-Smart-Console (dnssc).

If you're aware of other tools doing this or if it works for you let me
(agx@sigxcpu.org) know.
